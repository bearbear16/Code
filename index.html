<h2>Summary of the Shadow Club Rising</h2>
<p>At the start of the book, Jared is faced with the guilt of the actions he did months ago. He desperately wants other people to look at him another way, but his reputation is fatally crushed. Tyson tells him, "Sometimes people see you the way they want to see you, no matter how hard you try to change it. It's like they'd rather twist the whole world just so they can keep seeing you the same lousy way." Then, Alec Smartz moves into town. Alec is good at a lot of things, and that causes a lot of people to hate him. Someone puts a skunk in Alec's minivan, and Jared's shirt button is found on Alec's driveway, even though Jared was never there. The school counselor, Mr. Greene calls Jared into his office and blames him for putting the skunk in Alec's minivan. When Jared denies it, Mr. Greene shows him the button. Jared realizes that everyone will consider him guilty until he finds the real culprit. To flush out the real culprit, he turns his reputation into the bad kid, which he calls "Shaditude". Then, O.P., a former member of the Shadow Club shows Jared a piece of paper that was slipped into her backpack. It says, "We're on your side.", and on the back of it, is Alec's medical information. Jared and O.P. then learns that Alec is allergic to penicillin. Jared then theorizes that it means that someone is going to pull a nasty trick on Alec involving penicillin. He sprints across to where Alec is eating lunch and knocks Alec's soda out of his hands. Jared is relieved that there is no penicillin in the soda. Alec is mad at Jared and asks him why he did it, but Jared does not tell. After that, Alec takes a bite of his chili which has penicillin in it. Alec's face starts puffing up and Jared rushes him to the nurse. Jared knew that everyone would blame him, so he runs away from school. As he is running, his dad pulls up next to him and tells him to get him. Jared's dad tells him that he will have a meeting with Principal Diller tomorrow. His dad also indirectly accuses Jared for the pranks on Alec. The next day, Jared and his parents go to the meeting with the principal. Jared is sent to talk with Mr. Greene. Jared is surprised to find the members of the Shadow Club in the office. Mr. Greene tells Jared that he knows he is innocent. The members of the Shadow Club had told Mr. Greene about why Jared was innocent. At first Mr. Greene didn't believe them, but Austin confessed about putting Jared's button on Alec’s driveway. After that, Jared comes up with a plan to find the culprit. The plan was to fake expel the former members of the Shadow Club so that the culprit would crack. However, after the members of the Shadow Club got "expelled", things only got worse. Solerno's, Hilda McBroom, Garson Underwood, Regina Pfeiffer, and Mr. Greene were terrorized by nasty pranks. Jared goes to Mr. Greene's house to find out what happened. Mr. Greene's house was trashed and anything that was breakable was broken. On the way home, Jared is knocked out by Alec. When he wakes up, he finds himself tied up in Alec's minivan. After that, Alec gets a jug full of bees and puts it over Jared's head. Alec accuses Jared for what happened to him. A single sting from a bee can kill Jared. Then, Jodi, a part of the new Shadow Club, rescues Jared and takes Alec to a tugboat which they call the Ghosties. When Jared arrives there, Alec is tied up to the post and he is beaten up. There is a group of 20 or 30 kids crowding around Alec, triumph in their eyes. Jared tries to tell all of them to stop, but Brett, the new leader of the Shadow Club, throws him to the side of the boat. This causes the tugboat to tilt. Jared tries to tell everyone to stay still, but Brett tries to escape. Because of this, kids start panicking and rush to one side of the boat. The boat falls into the ocean. Jared and Tyson are helping kids get out of the tugboat when they realize that they didn't see Alec. Jared and Tyson dive underwater to find Alec, and they find him huddled up in the tugboat's pilothouse. Jared tries to convince Alec to come with them, but Alec says he wants to die. Then, the boat hits the bottom and a metal crossbar falls on top of Alec. Jared and Tyson can’t do anything, so they swim up to the dock and tell the Shadow Club that they need help. But no one helps. Jared dives underwater to retrieve Alec's body, and hauls him onto the dock. Jared tells everyone that Alec won't be bothering anyone anymore. Jared then tells Jodi to close Alec's eyes. When Jodi is about to touch Alec's eyelids, Alec says, "Get out of my face". All along, Jared had planned to use Alec as the “silver bullet”, to put the Shadow Club to an end. When Jared asks the Shadow Club if it is dead, everyone is so tormented by the shock that most people say "yes". There are only 5 or 6 kids that say "no". After that, the police arrive to investigate. For an excuse, Alec tells the police that they were doing Polar Bear Club, swimming in the middle of winter. The next day, Jared tells Mr. Greene that The Shadow Club finally took a "silver bullet". Mr. Greene thanks Jared and asks him if it has anything to do with Brett's disappearance. Jared tells him that Brett ran away when he found out that he had "killed" Alec Smartz. Jared knows he has to do something to turn the Shadow Club into a good thing. He tells all the members of the former Shadow Club to go and give back for what they did wrong. They go to all the victims and pay off their debt. However, Jared knows that some people, like Jodi, won't learn from their mistakes. So, Jared mails a seashell to Jodi. The purpose of it is so that when Jodi puts it to her ear, she will hear the chaos she helped cause.
